# Hi, I'm Tanvir Ahamed

Back in 2021, I wrote my first line of code on a borrowed laptop, just trying to understand how websites work. That curiosity turned into a passion for software engineering. Despite pausing to focus on academics, I kept learning in the background, mastering web development and diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to sharpen my problem-solving skills. In 2024, I returned with a clear goal: to build impactful solutions as a professional full-stack developer.

I specialize in crafting scalable web applications using Next.js, React, and TypeScript for intuitive UIs, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL for robust APIs. My code follows clean architecture principles, ensuring readability and maintainability. I‚Äôm also passionate about DSA, actively solving problems on LeetCode to enhance my algorithmic thinking.

üí° **My superpower?** I learn by building. From donation platforms with payment gateways to role-based e-commerce dashboards, I dive deep, solve challenges, and bring ideas to life.

I‚Äôm a sharer too ‚Äî I write beginner-friendly blogs on [Medium]([https://medium.com/@tanvir-ahamed](https://medium.com/@tanvirTheDev)), explaining DSA patterns and coding concepts in simple terms. I believe teaching reflects true understanding.

üîç **What‚Äôs it like to work with me?**
- I ask thoughtful questions, listen actively, and communicate clearly
- I persist through challenges, debugging and iterating until solutions work
- I thrive in collaborative teams that value growth and shared goals

I‚Äôm seeking a team where I can contribute to meaningful projects, grow alongside talented developers, and keep improving daily.
